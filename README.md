# Non-free software ABBS/ACBS
This repo contains build configurations and scripts for some non-free packages (like some commercial softwares) that not available in the official AOSC OS repository.

## ATTENTION
- The only applicable object of the `GPL-2.0 License` is the **build scripts** here, which has nothing to do with associated softwares.
- This repo doesn't and will not provide any binary packages, you are supposed to clone this and build those packages manually.
- Creating this repo is my personal behavior and has nothing to do with AOSC-Dev organization.
